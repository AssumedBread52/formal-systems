# Docker compose

This is a tool that comes installed with Docker Desktop for Windows. This greatly simplifies management of docker containers. Many commonly used docker commands require a considerable number of arguments dictating port exposure, volumes, etc. A docker-compose.yml file allows up to put all that in a file as a part of the project.
