# Decisions

As this project is developed many decisions will be made. It is imperative that the reasons behind every decision be documented.

## Explaining decisions

Every decision made must be able to be explained. Documenting the reasons a choice was made will make satisfying this constraint trivial.

## Decisions may always be revisited

No decision is ever made permanent. As new tools are developed and existing one are changed the best fit at one time may not be the best fit in the future. Therefore, we must always be open to changing our minds. However, we must understand that every change has a cost. This means all decisions must be made with the long term in mind.

## Initial decisions

Most initial decisions may not have good documentation. This can be due to a variety of reasons.
1. The problem is relatively new and not many are working on a solution.
2. Some solutions exist but they come at to high a cost. Cost meaning paid services, time needed to learn how to best incorporate the solution into the project, etc.
3. There are too many solutions to consider it worthwile to investigate alternatives.

The idea behind the initial documentation is that it can be expanded upon later. Record any options considered and factors that played into that choice being made. Any time an alternative is proposed we only need to adjust as necessary.
